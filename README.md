# Patient_Survival_Prediction
### Problem statement:
In the clinical setting, it is significant to enhance clinical decision-making processes and improve patient outcomes. We are required to develop a model that can effectively predict the likelihood of survival for patients based on relevant medical data and variables.

### Project objectives:
1) To develop machine learning algorithms and evaluate the model performance using evaluation metrics.
2) To predict the survival of patient on new unseen data.
